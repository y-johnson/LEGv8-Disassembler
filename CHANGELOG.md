Added labeling.

* The implementation currently labels either forward or backwards with the ability to change numbered offsets into the
  label name.

The program now passes the first argument as a filename.

Miscellaneous refactoring.

### 12/1/2021 13:52

Added proper binary to String parsing for all required instruction types.

* Output is consistent to the written language bar two things: labels and indentation. Indentation is outside the scope
  of the requirements so labels should be the last major objective.

Added Main.
